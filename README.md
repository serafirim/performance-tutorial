## How To Avoid Performance Pitfalls in React with memo, useMemo, and useCallback
My code that I wrote after learning from [a post on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-avoid-performance-pitfalls-in-react-with-memo-usememo-and-usecallback) about avoiding performance pitfalls in React with memo, useMemo, and useCallback. This is vital to the survival as a React developer. What spawned me onto what to learn this is, a product I am working on, [MERNStackStarter](https://github.com/serafirim/MERNStackStarter), has states and I was confused about what was going on.
